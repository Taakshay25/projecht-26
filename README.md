Wash a fresh lime before cutting it.
Fill a glass with water and squeeze the juice from a piece of the lime into the water.
To make lime water ahead of time, fill a pitcher with water and squeeze in the juice of a whole lime.
Add lime slices to the pitcher for added flavor.
Drink the water within 1 day for best flavor.
